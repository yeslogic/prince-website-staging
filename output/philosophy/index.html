<p>We are proud members of the Web generation. And printing is our
passion. Combining the two has been difficult until now; browsers work
hard to get every pixel right on the screen, but pay little attention
to printing. We think it is possible to use key Web standards like
XML, XHTML, CSS and SVG to create beautiful PDF documents fit for
printing. Actually, we know this for a fact since we do it every day.</p>

<h2>Commitment to standards</h2>

<p>Using Web standards to create PDF files has significant benefits.
Over the last decade, the Web has changed the way information is
produced, distributed and consumed. Many people know Web standards,
and there is an abundance of software that can process XML, XHTML, CSS
and SVG. Since these formats are open in every sense of the word, you
will never find yourself locked into a proprietary format. PDF is an
industry standard created and controlled by Adobe, but the format is
well documented and viewer software exists for most platforms.</p>

<h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>

<p>CSS and XSL are both style sheet languages developed by W3C. CSS is
used to style most Web sites, while XSL is used in the printing
industry. Prince is based on CSS, not XSL. The two languages are quite
different, but can often accomplish the same tasks. XML.com has <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/01/19/print.html">published an
article</a>

that compared how XSL and CSS could be used to format the
same types of documents.</p>

<p>Briefly described, CSS is a simpler language with only one goal in
mind: formatting documents. XSL, on the other hand, is a programming
language which also can be used to format documents. While there are
things XSL can do which CSS can't (most importantly, reorder elements
in a document) we believe CSS is a better choice for most printing
needs. First, CSS is a compact language which is readable and
maintainable by humans. Second, CSS style sheets are widely used on
the Web and these can often be reused for printing. Third, the things
CSS can't do (again, reordering is the most imporant) is more
naturally done before formatting the document.
