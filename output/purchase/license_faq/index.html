<h1 class="subpages-heading2">Prince License FAQ</h1>
<div class="content750">

<p>
Prince may be purchased under one of several licenses.
The <a href="/license/">EULA</a> describes the licenses in a legal
language.
This document tries to answer frequently asked questions about the licenses
in a common language.
</p>

<h2 id="other">General questions</h2>

<dl>

<dt>I want to use Prince in a server farm. Do you offer site licenses?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Absolutely, our <a href="#csl">Commercial Site License</a> is perfect for running in the
cloud or on your own cluster.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Do you also license Prince for use on a single server?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
We offer Per-Server Licensing to government institutions and other
non-commercial services.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>How fast and reliable is your support?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Very. While we do not promise numbers in the EULA, we do our best and
we're very good at what we do.
The <a href="/forum/">Prince Forum</a> shows the quality and timeliness
of the support we provide.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="reseller">Do you have a reseller program?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
Not really. We typically sell directly to customers. In the past
we have found that direct contact is the most efficient.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="csl">Commercial Site License</h2>

<dl>
<dt>What is a Commercial Site License?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A Commercial Site License allows Prince to be run on any number of servers – in the cloud or on your own cluster – for an annual fee which includes upgrades and support. The documents you generate can be of commercial nature, e.g. invoices, reports, monthly statements, and other communication to customers you have a commercial relationship with.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>How much does a Commercial Site License cost?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Fees are based on the type and number of documents you generate. Prince is a high-end product, but fees are reasonable and start around US$2000. Please contact us for a friendly quote.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>I'm planning to generate documents (e.g. invoices, receipts or sales
proposals) that I will send to my customers. I will not charge for these
documents. Do I need a Commercial Site License to use Prince for this?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Yes, you will need a Commercial Site License if you generate documents that you send to customers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
I'm planning to create a document conversion service where customers pay to
use Prince running on my servers. Do I need a Commercial Site License for this?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Definitely.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Are there any restrictions on what kind of servers Prince can be
installed on?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
No, if you have a Commercial Site License you may install Prince on any type
of server regardless of memory, clock speed, processors or cores.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>May I install Prince on more than one server with a Commercial Site
License?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Yes, with a Commercial Site License you may install Prince on any number of servers needed to run your service.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Can a Commercial Site License serve any number of domains? For example, can I power both make-really-nice-cool-invoices.com and make-good-looking-vouchers.com from the same license?
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
We can give you an offer for serving both domains. Please contact us.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>What information do you need to send me a quote?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Please tell us what kind of content will processed (invoices? textbooks?),
whether you will brand the documents yourself or if they will be branded others
(which logo will be on top of the documents?), from which domain(s) the
documents will be offered, and how many documents you expect to generate per
month.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="oem">OEM License</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Who needs a Prince OEM License?</dt>

<dd><p>You need an OEM License if you want to redistribute Prince, e.g.
as part of your own product.</p></dd>

<dt>How much does a Prince OEM License cost?</dt>

<dd><p>Prices are negotiated on a case-by-case basis: the
price and expected distribution of the application is taken into
account. If you tell us more about your application — what it
does, how many copies you expect to sell/distribute, and what you plan
to charge — we will provide you with a price quote. You can
<a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p></dd>

<dt>Are there any commercial services that offer online use of Prince?</dt>

<dd><p>Yes, <a href="https://www.docraptor.com">DocRaptor</a>.</p></dd>

</dl>


<h2 id="non-commercial">Non-commercial License</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Is the Prince Non-commercial License really free?</dt>
<dd><p>Yes.</p></dd>

<dt>Can be used on a server?</dt>
<dd><p>Yes.</p></dd>

<dt>So what's the catch?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
There's a logo in the upper right corner on the first page of generated PDF
files.
You are not allowed to remove the logo (e.g., by removing the first
page of the PDF file) or assist or encourage others to remove it.
</p>

<p>Also, you must place prominent links to <a href="https://www.princexml.com">www.princexml.com</a> on your Web site,
at the places the PDF documents are served and in a page listing your
partners.
If you send the PDF documents in email, the message body must contain our
URL.
</p>

<p>
Prince and the Generated PDFs must be used for non-commercial purposes (see
follow up questions).
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Does my organization qualify for the Non-commercial License?</dt>

<dd>
<p>The license doesn't distinguish between commercial and non-commercial
organizations.
Instead, it distinguishes between commercial and non-commercial purposes.
This is the key sentence from the license:</p>

<blockquote>
  "Non-commercial Purposes" means the production of documents (a) for
  which no fees are charged, and (b) which are not part of a
  monetary transaction system (such as, but not limited, to invoices
  and receipts), and (c) for which no other income (such as, but not
  limited to, subscription fees, income from advertising, or sale of
  consumables) is generated.
</blockquote>
</dd>

<dt>So, even commercial organizations can use the Non-commercial
License as long as they use it for non-commercial purposes?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Correct. For example, a newspaper may offer PDF versions of their
articles using the Non-commercial License; as long as the articles are
offered at no cost without any advertising.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Can non-commercial organizations use the Non-commercial License
for all sorts of purposes?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
No. Non-commercial organizations can only use the Non-commercial
License for non-commercial purposes. For example, they cannot use the
Non-commercial License to generate documents for which they charge
fees, nor can they use the non-commercial License to create invoices.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Can I use the Non-commercial License on my server, even if I have
advertising on my site?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Yes, as long as the advertising doesn't appear in the generated
PDF documents.</p>
</dd>

<dt>I don't have third-party advertising in the PDF documents I
generate, but promotions for my own sites and services are inserted.
Is is OK to use the Non-commercial License for this purpose?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Not if those other sites or services are of commercial nature. For
example, you may not promote services for which you charge
subscription fees. If in doubt,
<a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt>I run a fee-based service that offers PDF documents as part of the
service, but users do not pay extra for the PDF documents. Is it OK to
use the Non-commercial License to generate these PDF documents?</dt>

<dd><p>You may do so if the PDF documents are also available to others without
paying the fees and under the same terms.
Also, remember to link back to the
<a href="https://www.princexml.com">www.princexml.com</a> website.</p></dd>

<dt>My community organization that would like to use Prince for its membership
materials, like flyers and newsletters.
May I use the Non-commercial version of Prince to produce these?</dt>

<dd><p>You may do so if the PDF documents are also available to others without
paying the fees and under the same terms.
Also, remember to link back to the
<a href="https://www.princexml.com">www.princexml.com</a> website.</p></dd>

<dt>Am I allowed to use the Non-commercial version to create printed
books?</dt>

<dd><p>Only if those books are distributed for free, or at the cost of
printing.</p></dd>

<dt>Why should I buy a license when you offer a free license?</dt>

<dd>
<p>There are several good reasons to buy a license:</p>

<ul>
<li>to remove the watermark; all non-free licenses remove the
watermark</li>
<li>to use Prince for commercial purposes; all non-free licenses
can be used for commercial purposes (but some restrictions apply, see
below)</li>
<li>to redistribute Prince as part of your own product (for this
you need an <a href="#oem">OEM License</a>)</li>
<li>to support our work!
We are passionate about printing the web and license fees are our only
income.</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<dt>I'd like to use the non-commercial license on my site. Do I need to report
this to you?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Please send an email to feedback@princexml.com with the address of your site.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="server">Per-Server Licensing</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Do you offer Per-Server Licensing of Prince?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Yes, we offer Prince Server Licenses to government institutions and other non-commercial services. Here's our discount ladder:

</div>
</dd>

<dt>We are local government. We have one production server, one standby
server, and one development machine. Do we need to purchase three Prince
Server Licenses for our use?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
No, one License is sufficient. One Prince Server License can only run on one production server, but the license can be installed on up to two other computers.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Why is Per-Server Licensing only offered to government institutions and
other non-commercial services?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Most companies have moved to server farms or cloud services where the
Commercial Site License makes more sense as you do not need to count servers. Also, a Prince Server License cannot be used to generate documents of commercial nature, e.g. communiation between a comany and its customers.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>My company has a Prince Server License from the past. I would like to
upgrade, and perhaps buy a few more. Is this possible?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Due to the restrictions on Prince Server Licenses, your existing Prince Server
License may not be suitable for your current use. We will take your existing
licenses into account when giving you a quote for a Commercial Site License.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>My company has a Prince Server License which we use to create documents
that are available to everyone on the internet, at no charge. Can we continue
to use the Server License this way?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Yes.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="desktop">Desktop License</h2>

<dl>

<dt>What can the the Prince Desktop License be used for?</dt>

<dd>
<p>The Desktop License can be used by authors who self-publish their books,
and by organizations that create documents for internal use.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="desktop-interactive">
Can I install the Prince Desktop License on a server?
</dt>

<dd><p>
No. A Desktop License can only be installed on single desktop computer, and
Prince must be operated by a human sitting by that computer, either via the GUI
or command line. You cannot log into a remote computer to use the Desktop
License.
</p></dd>

<dt>Are there any other restrictions?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
The Desktop license may only be used for self-publishing, or for producing
documents for internal use.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>How do you define "self-publishing"?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Self-publishing means the publication of documents by authors at their own
cost, without the involvement of a publisher.
</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="academic">Academic Discount Licenses</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Do you offer academic discounts</dt>

<dd>
<p>
Yes, Academic discounts apply to the Server and Desktop Licenses and reduce
the price by 50%.
Academic discounts are available to academic institutions and
restrictions apply (see below).
</p>
</dd>

<dt>I am a teacher/student, am I eligible for an academic discount?</dt>

<dd>

<p>
No, academic discounts apply to academic institutions such as schools and
universities.
You could ask your institution to purchase the software for you or the
<a href="#non-commercial">Non-commercial License</a> may be suitable.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>What restrictions apply to an Academic License?</dt>

<dd><p>An Academic License can only be used for academic
purposes. By this we mean the production of dissertations, papers,
lecture notes, hand-outs and similar documents or publications of
academic character for distribution on the Web, at lectures, or
through university bookstores or similar academic channels that are
not of a strictly commercial character. A university press run on
commercial terms is considered to be strictly commercial.</p></dd>
