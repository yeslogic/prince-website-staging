				<title>ABOUT THIS LETTER</title>
				<p>Paul mentions Titus several times in his letters as someone who worked with him in Asia Minor and Greece (<reference osisRef="2Cor.2.13">2 Corinthians 2.13</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.7.6-2Cor.7.13">7.6,13</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.8.6">8.6</reference>,<reference osisRef="2Cor.8.16">16</reference>,<reference osisRef="2Cor.8.23">23</reference>; <reference osisRef="2Cor.12.18">12.18</reference>; <reference osisRef="Gal.2.3">Galatians 2.3</reference>). He is told by Paul to appoint church leaders and officials in Crete.</p>
				<p>Paul instructs Titus to make sure that church leaders and officials have good reputations <reference osisRef="Titus.1.5-Titus.1.9">(1.5-9)</reference> and that all of the Lord's followers keep themselves pure and avoid arguments <reference osisRef="Titus.1.10-Titus.2.9">(1.10--2.9)</reference>.</p>
				<p>Paul includes special instructions for the different groups within the church in Crete. He reminds Titus that a new way of life is possible because of what God has done by sending Jesus Christ: God has saved them, washed them by the power of the Holy Spirit, and given them a fresh start and the hope of eternal life.</p>
				<p>Paul also tells how we are saved:</p>
				<lg>
					<l>God our Savior showed us<lb type='x-secondLine'/>how good and kind he is.</l>
					<l>He saved us because<lb type='x-secondLine'/>of his mercy,</l>
					<l>and not because<lb type='x-secondLine'/>of any good things<lb type='x-secondLine'/>that we have done. <reference osisRef="Titus.3.4-Titus.3.5!a">(3.4,5a)</reference></l>

				<title>What Titus Was To Do in Crete</title>
				<p>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.5' osisID='Titus.1.5'/>I left you in Crete to do what had been left undone and to appoint leaders <note type='alternative' osisRef='Titus.1.5' osisID='Titus.1.5!note'><catchWord>leaders</catchWord><rdg>elders</rdg> or <rdg>presbyters</rdg> or <rdg>priests.</rdg></note> for the churches in each town. As I told you,<verse eID='Titus.1.5'/>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.6' osisID='Titus.1.6'/>
					<note type='crossReference' osisRef='Titus.1.6' osisID='Titus.1.6!crossReference'><reference osisRef="1Tim.3.2-1Tim.3.7">1Ti 3.2-7.</reference></note> they must have a good reputation and be faithful in marriage. <note type='alternative' osisRef='Titus.1.6' osisID='Titus.1.6!note'><catchWord>be faithful in marriage</catchWord><rdg>be the husband of only one wife</rdg> or <rdg>have never been divorced.</rdg></note> Their children must be followers of the Lord and not have a reputation for being wild and disobedient.<verse eID='Titus.1.6'/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.7' osisID='Titus.1.7'/>Church officials <note type='alternative' osisRef='Titus.1.7' osisID='Titus.1.7!note'><catchWord>Church officials</catchWord><rdg>Bishops.</rdg></note> are in charge of God's work, and so they must also have a good reputation. They must not be bossy, quick-tempered, heavy drinkers, bullies, or dishonest in business.<verse eID='Titus.1.7'/>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.8' osisID='Titus.1.8'/>Instead, they must be friendly to strangers and enjoy doing good things. They must also be sensible, fair, pure, and self-controlled.<verse eID='Titus.1.8'/>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.9' osisID='Titus.1.9'/>They must stick to the true message they were taught, so that their good teaching can help others and correct everyone who opposes it.<verse eID='Titus.1.9'/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.10' osisID='Titus.1.10'/>There are many who don't respect authority, and they fool others by talking nonsense. This is especially true of some Jewish followers.<verse eID='Titus.1.10'/>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.11' osisID='Titus.1.11'/>But you must make them be quiet. They are after money, and they upset whole families by teaching what they should not.<verse eID='Titus.1.11'/>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.12' osisID='Titus.1.12'/>It is like one of their own prophets once said,</p>
				<lg>
					<l>"The people of Crete<lb type='x-secondLine'/>always tell lies.</l>
					<l>They are greedy and lazy<lb type='x-secondLine'/>like wild animals."</l><verse eID='Titus.1.12'/>
				</lg>
				<p>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.13' osisID='Titus.1.13'/>That surely is a true saying. And you should be hard on such people, so you can help them grow stronger in their faith.<verse eID='Titus.1.13'/>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.14' osisID='Titus.1.14'/>Don't pay any attention to any of those senseless Jewish stories and human commands. These are made up by people who won't obey the truth.<verse eID='Titus.1.14'/>
				</p>
				<p>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.15' osisID='Titus.1.15'/>Everything is pure for someone whose heart is pure. But nothing is pure for an unbeliever with a dirty mind. That person's mind and conscience are destroyed.<verse eID='Titus.1.15'/>
					<verse sID='Titus.1.16' osisID='Titus.1.16'/>Such people claim to know God, but their actions prove that they really don't. They are disgusting. They won't obey God, and they are too worthless to do anything good.<verse eID='Titus.1.16'/>

					<verse sID='Titus.2.9' osisID='Titus.2.9'/>Tell slaves always to please their owners by obeying them in everything. Slaves must not talk back to their owners<verse eID='Titus.2.9'/>
