			<h2>Håkon Wium Lie, Chairman</h2>
			<p>
			<a href="https://www.princexml.com/howcome/">Håkon</a> is a web
            pioneer, having created CSS while working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN
            in 1994.  Håkon became a devotee of Prince when looking for a
            CSS-based tool which could format his book on CSS, co-authored with
            Bert Bos.  Håkon has been the director of
            <a href="https://yeslogic.com/">Yeslogic</a>, the company that makes
            the Prince formatter, since 2004.  In 2015 he took a break to see if
            the web is truly worldwide: as the CTO of the
            <a href="//www.kontiki2.com">Kon-Tiki2</a> Expedition he communicted
            over a thin satellite connection from a balsawood raft, sailing from
            Lima to Easter Island in 43 days.

<h2>Brendan</h2>
<p>
Brendan has a background in communication design, illustration, generative art, and open source software development. He is fascinated by the intersection of art, design, mathematics and computer science. His current focus is exploring how programming languages and type systems can be used as a tool for designing safer, more robust and friendly software. This involves keeping abreast of past and present academic research and figuring out ways to integrate this into industrial applications.

Peter works on Prince and other things. Enjoys tea &amp; biscuits, and extreme 17th century revivalist yak herding.

<h2>Sasha</h2>
<p>
Sasha is a software developer at YesLogic, where she explores new ways to bridge the gap between what users want and the technical reality of what computers can do. Her work includes research into formal systems, optimisation problems, abstract algebra and topology, among other things; oh, and lots of head-scratching. Having had her start in high school making a website for one of her teachers, Sasha has since worked in a wide range of roles, from developing progressive web applications and cloud infrastructure, to interactive network visualisations and data engineering. When she's not buried in computer code or research papers though, she also likes to sing and write music, write and have long meandering conversations over a cup of tea.
