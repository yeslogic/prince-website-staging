<h2 id="p60r1">
    Prince 6.0 rev 1
</h2>
<p class="date">May 2007</p>

<h3>Hyphenation</h3>

prince-hyphenate-before: &lt;int&gt;

sheets, images and even fonts.

border-top-left-radius: &lt;length&gt; [ &lt;length&gt; ]
border-top-right-radius: &lt;length&gt; [ &lt;length&gt; ]
border-bottom-left-radius: &lt;length&gt; [ &lt;length&gt; ]
border-bottom-right-radius: &lt;length&gt; [ &lt;length&gt; ]
</pre>
<p>
(Similar properties are available in the Mozilla Firefox browser, where they
are prefixed with "-moz-").
</p>
<h3>MathML</h3>
<p>

prototype of MathML support in Prince, so feedback from MathML users would be
greatly appreciated.
</p>
<h3>SVG</h3>

<li>Support for the &lt;use&gt;, &lt;symbol&gt; and &lt;defs&gt;
elements.</li>
<li>Support for marker symbols on paths.</li>
<li>Support for the fill-opacity and stroke-opacity properties.</li>
<li>Initial support for linear and radial gradients.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multiple Documents</h3>
<p>
Support for converting multiple input documents into a single output PDF file.
Currently this functionality can only be accessed from the command-line.
Useful for converting a collection of linked documents or an entire website into
a single PDF file.
</p>
<h3>Columns</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Support for unbalanced columns as well as balanced columns. 
The column type is controlled using the new <code>column-fill</code>
property:
</p>
<pre>
column-fill: auto | balance
</pre>
<p>
In balanced columns, content is distributed among the columns such that they
all have similar length. In automatic columns, the content simply fills each
column one at a time, with the last columns shorter or entirely empty. This
layout is commonly seen in articles produced using LaTeX.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Columns can be specified by width using the new <code>column-width</code>
property or by number using the existing <code>column-count</code> property:
</p>
<pre>
column-count: &lt;number&gt;
column-width: &lt;length&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A new <code>columns</code> shorthand property accepts either a number of
columns or a column width:
</p>
<pre>
columns: &lt;number&gt; | &lt;length&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Two new properties are available for inducing column breaks in content within
columns:
</p>
<pre>
column-break-after: auto | always
column-break-before: auto | always
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The properties for controlling page breaking now apply to content within
columns. This includes <code>page-break-after</code>,
<code>page-break-before</code> and <code>page-break-inside</code>.
Specifically, a value of <code>avoid</code> will inhibit page breaking
<em>and</em> column breaking.
</p>
<pre>
page-break-after: avoid	    /* also inhibits column breaks */
page-break-before: avoid    /* also inhibits column breaks */
page-break-inside: avoid    /* also inhibits column breaks */
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <code>widows</code> and <code>orphans</code> properties now apply to
content within columns.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Footnotes can now occur within page floats and within other footnotes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <code>footnote</code> counter is now incremented automatically at each
footnote and does not need to be manually incremented.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A new symbolic counter style allows footnotes to use common footnote symbols
such as asterisks and daggers instead of just numbers:
</p>
<pre>
::footnote-call {
    content: counter(footnote, symbols('*', '+', '!'))
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Floats</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Support for column floats, which are similar to page floats but restricted to
a single column instead of the whole page:
</p>
<pre>
float: prince-column-top | prince-column-bottom
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for optional floats, in which content is floated to the top/bottom of
the next page/column only if it will not fit in the current location:
</p>
<pre>
float: prince-top-if-necessary | prince-bottom-if-necessary
float: prince-column-top-if-necessary | prince-column-bottom-if-necessary
</pre>
<p>
This feature provides a flexible alternative to regular page/column floats,
which always move the content to the top/bottom of the page/column. 

Regular page/column floats always move the content to the top/bottom of the
page/column. Optional floats are more flexible: they only float the content if
it doesn't fit on the page.
</p>
<p>
Both of these methods are good ways of including large images in a document
without causing gaps to appear at the bottom of the page preceding the image.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
A new property for replacing text:
</p>
<pre>
prince-text-replace: none | [ &lt;string&gt; &lt;string&gt; ]+
</pre>
<p>
For example, this can be used to replace straight single apostrophes with
right single quotes without modifying the source document.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for the <code>xml:base</code> attribute and the XHTML
<code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for CMYK colors using the <code>cmyk()</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
color: cmyk(0.8, 0.5, 0.0, 0.3)
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for RGBA colors using the <code>rgba()</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
color: rgba(100%, 100%, 0%, 0.5)
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for capitalization:
</p>
<pre>
text-transform: capitalize
</pre>
<p>
The <code>text-transform</code> property now also applies to accented Latin
characters.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <code>flow</code> property now takes an optional second parameter allowing
content to be flowed into headers/footers that are earlier in the document:
</p>
<pre>
flow: static(&lt;ident&gt;, start | current)
</pre>
<p>
This is convenient when content at the end of the document needs to be placed
in a header/footer at the beginning.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Support for the <code>font-stretch</code> property on Linux and MacOS X, not
yet on Windows. This property is used to select a particular font based on its
width if multiple widths are available for a given font family:
</p>
<pre>
font-stretch: condensed
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Improved CSS parsing and error reporting for invalid style sheets.
